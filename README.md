This graduated Thesis is call “Study on parcel sorting system with scanning barcode”. This Thesis introduces the theory, details about the principles and controls of Arduino Uno R3, which use as a controller for motors, Photoelectric Sensor, Barcode Scanner Module and Servo Motor. Presents controlling between Arduino Uno R3 with computer to enter the command and presents the devices including input and output devices along with Installation and connection to be able to work together.
In addition, there is material sorting simulation were also tested along with explaining the operation and installation points of DC motors, Photoelectric Sensor, Barcode Scanner Module and Servo Motor follows to a simulation image and actual experimental work was performed.
